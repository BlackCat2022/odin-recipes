<h2>What exactly is a sand tart?</h2>
<p>Sand Tarts are buttery-flaky and delicious. They are similar to a Mexican Wedding Cookie or a Russian Tea Cake.</p>
<p>This recipe only has 6 ingredients (and one of them is water), and it's quite easy and quick to make. It has definitely become my go-to holiday recipe.</p>
<p>This recipe is my Great-great grandma Ama's recipe. I haven't changed anything, because it's simply the best cookie ever. And why mess with perfection?</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter (preferrably unsalted)</li>
        <li>4 TBSP powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp water</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
        <li>2 cups flour (I use all-purpose flour)</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans (can buy a bag of pre-chopped to save time)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 300  degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Cream butter, sugar and water until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Blend in vanilla, flour and nuts.</li>
            <li>Rolls into balls the size of walnuts. Dough will be very soft.</li>
            <li>Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes. Cookies do not brown.</li>
            <li>Roll in powdered sugar while still warm.</li>
            <li>Cool on cooling racks and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
