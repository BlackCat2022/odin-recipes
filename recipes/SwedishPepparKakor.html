<h2>Swedish Cookies that you can eat all year</h2>
<p>Pepparkakor cookies are a Swedish specialty found around Christmas. But I like to have them all year!</p>
<p>Pepparkakor cookies are spiced, crunchy and not too sweet. I really enjoy eating them with tea.</p>
<p>This recipe makes quite a lot of cookies, I like to make the dough and then freeze half and bake the other half. The dough does quite well in the freezer.</p>
