<h2>What makes this the best ever?</h2>
<p>This is the best recipe I've found for making creamy, restaurant-style hummus. It's quick to make and stores well in both th fridge and freezer.</p>
<p>You will need a food processor for the creamiest hummus, but a blender will still give you a nice smooth hummus.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cans of chickpeas (skins removed)</li>
        <li>150 mL aqua faba (from the cans of chickpeas)</li>
        <li>The juice from 1.5 lemons</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>8 TBSP tahini</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place all ingredients into food processor</li>
            <li>Process for 2-3 minutes (untill smooth)</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasonings to liking</li>
            <li>Just before serving, add small amount of olive oil and paprika to hummus

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once prepared, the hummmus can store in the fridge for about a week. Can also place in freezer for up to 3 months</p>
